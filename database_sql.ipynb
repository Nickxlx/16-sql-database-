    "\n",
    "Answer--> In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It must be unique and not null for each record in the table. A primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record in the table can be uniquely identified. For example, in a table of \"students\", the \"id\" column can be designated as the primary key, ensuring that each student has a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables, where the values in the foreign key column must match the values in the primary key column of the referenced table. For example, in a table of \"enrollments\", the \"student_id\" column can be designated as a foreign key, referring to the primary key of the \"students\" table. This ensures that each enrollment is associated with a valid student record.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish a relationship between tables. Together, they ensure data consistency and help to maintain the integrity of a relational database."

    "\n",
    "Answer-->\n",
    "In a typical SQL query, the clauses are executed in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 SELECT - This clause is used to select the columns and rows to be returned by the query. It is usually the first clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 FROM - This clause is used to specify the table or tables from which to retrieve the data. It follows the SELECT clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 WHERE - This clause is used to filter the results based on a specified condition. It follows the FROM clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 GROUP BY - This clause is used to group the results by one or more columns. It follows the WHERE clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 HAVING - This clause is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY clause based on a specified condition. It follows the GROUP BY clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 ORDER BY - This clause is used to sort the results based on one or more columns. It follows the HAVING clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 LIMIT - This clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by the query. It is usually the last clause in a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
